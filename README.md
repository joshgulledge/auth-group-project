## Assignment Instructions

### BASE MODE

#### FEATURES

We recommend working in groups of 4 or 6 and pair programming for this project. Each pair should take on one of the following features. You will want to identify any tasks that need to be finished in a particular order as a group to avoid merge conflicts. Each of the following features should be on a separate route.

##### Display all Items

The Shelf page (`ShelfPage.js`at `/shelf`) should show all of the items stored in the database in a list or table.

##### Add Items to the Shelf

The Shelf page (`ShelfPage.js` at `/shelf`) should allow a user to add a new item to the database (which should immediately appear in the list).

> NOTE: Image url should be a full path to an existing image on the web. You should not attempt to implement image upload for this.

##### Delete Items from the Shelf

An authenticated user should be able to delete items from the shelf if they were the one who added the item to the shelf.

> NOTE: This should require client and server changes. An unauthenticated attacker from Postman should not be able to delete anything.

### Stretch Goals

- Ability to edit an existing item on the shelf from the info page.
- Have anyone, not just logged in users, be able to see what is on the shelf, but not edit, remove, nor add.
- Add a new route to display all items for a specific user called "My Shelf". The client-side url should be `/shelf/2` where `/2` should be the id of the logged in user. Only the items associated with the specific logged in user should be displayed on this new page.
- Use "Filestack" for image upload on the add page.
- Style the application with Material-UI.
